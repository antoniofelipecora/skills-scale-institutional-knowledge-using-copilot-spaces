# OctoAcme — Project Management Overview

Brief overview
OctoAcme follows a lightweight, outcome-driven project management approach: work is captured and prioritized as issues, planned into short iterations, and delivered through cross-functional squads that combine product, engineering, and QA ownership. Communication is documented asynchronously in the repo and issues, with focused synchronous meetings for planning and escalation. Quality assurance combines automated CI, defined review gates, and staged releases to ensure reliability while enabling rapid iteration.

Detailed summary
This repository documents OctoAcme’s project management practices used to coordinate work across product, engineering, and operations teams. OctoAcme follows a lightweight, outcome-driven process: incoming work is captured as issues, prioritized by product stakeholders during weekly intake sessions, and scheduled into short iterations (typically two-week sprints). The intake and prioritization workflow is explicit — issues use templates that capture goals, acceptance criteria, impact, and required stakeholders — which reduces rework and ensures every task maps to a measurable product outcome.

Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined to reduce ambiguity. Product Managers (PMs) own prioritization, roadmaps, and stakeholder alignment; Engineering Leads are responsible for technical scope, estimates, and implementation plans; QA Engineers design and maintain test plans and automation; a Release Manager coordinates deployments and rollbacks. Cross-functional squads include at least one PM, one engineering lead, and one QA assigned per feature to ensure rapid decision making and continuous ownership from concept through production.

Communication emphasizes asynchronous documentation and focused synchronous checkpoints. The team uses the docs folder + issue threads as the canonical source of truth, with design notes and decisions recorded on issues or in doc files. Daily standups are short and used for immediate blockers only; weekly triage cycles and sprint planning sessions align priorities. There are dedicated channels (chat + tagged issue notifications) for incident triage, feature reviews, and release coordination to keep noise contained and make escalation paths explicit.

Quality assurance is layered: automated CI runs unit, integration, and smoke tests on every push; PRs must pass CI and receive at least one approving review from an assigned reviewer before merge. Definition-of-done for work items includes passing automated tests, updated docs, and validation in a staging environment. Releases follow a checklist (pre-release validation, canary or phased rollout, monitoring checks) and post-release retrospectives capture actionable improvements. This combination of automation, formal review, and documented release playbooks helps OctoAcme maintain high reliability while iterating quickly.
